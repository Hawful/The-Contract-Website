                    I see you've already logged in. That's great! <a href="/">Your home page</a> acts as centralized

                Once you've satisfied your curiosity, it's time to start Playing!
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Read the <a href="/wiki/rules/">Rules</a></h2>
            <p>
                As the person introducing The Contract to your group, you will act as a rules resource.
                Read <a href="/wiki/rules/">The Players Guide</a> sequentially for a complete picture of how The Contract
                works.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time you've read through the section on
                <a href="/wiki/Rules/4-running-contract/">Running The Contract</a>, you will be more than prepared to
                teach your group the rules and act as Game Master for your first sesion of The Contract.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Rules can easily be referenced from anywhere on the site via the search box or dropdown menu in the upper toolbar.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Prepare to GM</h2>
            <p>
                <b class="lead">Gather your Players</b>, and pitch them on the idea of playing The Contract. Link them
                to the website, and let them explore the game for themselves. Each Player should
                <a href="{% url 'characters:characters_create'%}">Create a Contractor</a> before you start the first Game.
                This can be done either together in a session-zero or asynchronously, and it's a good time to start
                <a href="/wiki/Rules/4-running-contract/b-contractor-introductions/">Contractor introductions</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="lead">Read a Stock Scenario.</b> One Stock Scenario is available for free without an account
                <a href="/games/view/s/41/">here</a>. To access the other Stock Scenario, you must
                {% if not user.is_authenticated %}
                    <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">Sign up</a>, and
                {% endif %}
                <a href="{% url 'cells:cells_create' %}">Start a Cell</a>. The Scenario will then appear in your
                <a href="{% url 'games:games_view_scenario_gallery' %}">Scenario Gallery</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="lead">Optional: Organize a Cell.</b> Cells are a website feature that allows you to easily
                track your setting, your Players, their Contractors, and the Games they've played.
                <a href="{% url 'cells:cells_create' %}">Click here</a> to start a cell. Once you do, you can invite your
                Players (if they've made accounts), and they can declare your new Cell as their Contractors' home Cell.
                As Cell Leader, you can record Games that have already occurred, help your Players manage their Character
                Sheets, and edit your Cell's Setting.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3: Run a Game</h2>
            <p>
                If you've read <a href="/wiki/rules/">The Guide</a> and the Stock Scenario, you should be more than
                prepared to run your first Game. Get your Players togther and have at it. : )
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4: Record your Game</h2>
                <p>
                    Recording played Games unlocks the full potential of The Contract's website. Declaring the outcome
                    gets you far more than just an easily accessible record of who played which Contractors in which Scenarios.
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players are notified that their Contractors have Gifts and Experience to spend</li>
                <li>Players are guided and helped to spend their unspent Rewards</li>
                <li>
                    The Game's Scenario appears in each Player's
                    <a href="{% url 'games:games_view_scenario_gallery' %}">Scenario Gallery</a>,
                    allowing them to run it in the future
                </li>
                <li>The source of all Experience / Gifts expended is recorded on their Character Sheets</li>
                <li>The GM receives their Rewards and is given an UI for allocating them to their Contractors</li>
                <li>
                    Contractors who died are declared dead and appear in
                    <a href="{% url 'characters:characters_graveyard'%}">the Graveyard</a>
                </li>
                <li>Contractors whose stats or Powers exceed their Rewards are flagged so GMs can vet them for shenanigans</li>
            </ul>

            To record a Game after the fact, visit your Cell and click "Declare a completed Game".
